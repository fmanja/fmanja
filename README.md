## Hi there 👋

I’m Frank Manja — I am obsessed with applying Generative AI to real world applications. My career journey has included Dept. of Justice, Dept. of Energy, IBM, Emory University and The World Bank.

With over a decade of federal-service and private sector experience, I bridge the worlds of human capital, enterprise analytics, and cutting-edge AI/ML/cloud engineering. I employ a diverse set of technologies (ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, AWS, Vercel, Redis, Postgres, Oracle, Python, SQL, React, Next.js and TypeScript) to turn data, systems, and processes into strategic advantage.
