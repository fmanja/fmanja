## Hi there 👋

I’m Frank Manja — I am obsessed with applying Generative AI to real world applications. My career journey has included Dept. of Justice, Dept. of Energy, IBM, Emory University and The World Bank.

With over a decade of federal-service and private sector experience, I bridge the worlds of human capital, enterprise analytics, and cutting-edge AI/ML/cloud engineering. I employ a diverse set of technologies (ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, AWS, Vercel, Redis, Postgres, Oracle, Python, SQL, React, Next.js and TypeScript) to turn data, systems, and processes into strategic advantage.

## 2026 Projects

In 2026, I will release several open source projects starting with an <b>AI Position Description Generator</b>. 

<b>Features</b>

✅ Generate professional federal government job descriptions using Claude AI via AWS Bedrock

✅ OPM (Office of Personnel Management) job family and series data integration

✅ Support for multiple pay scales (GS, SES, ES, SL, ST, and others)

✅ Zod validation for all form inputs (client-side and server-side)

✅ Clean separation of concerns: React components call Next.js API routes

✅ TypeScript for type safety

✅ Loading states and error handling

✅ Field-level validation with user-friendly error messages

✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

✅ EC2 deployment
